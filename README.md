So yeah here we go :), i've tried to search for some application to compare two images but i never found something "good" for free.

But well yeah here we are, i have build some "application" before, but i've used some "code" from GitHub but you know...
SLOW, to much memory usage (8gb on 10gb), so i've build the "app" again.

The app it works just fine and it's the type of app that dosen't occupy any side of the monitor,
you open and then boom it dissapear until the end where you se a "massage" that tell you it's done and it will close in 5 second (just to tell everything it is done).

The main function of the app it is just to verify that in a "batch" of image (png/jpg/jpeg/etc...) there is no duplicate,

Now you can choose the "original" and the "not-original"   EXAMPLE:

Desktop > FolderOriginal1 > image1.png 
Desktop > FolderNOT-originalOriginal > image1 - copy.png ; image2.png

If you have the will and the time to change or update "at your maximum usage" fell free to do that, just give some credit.

The instruction are simple, first you select the "original" image and then the "not-original", when everything is finished a "results.txt" will appear in the app folder.
