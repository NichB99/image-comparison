So yeah here we go :), i've tried to search for some application to compare two images but i never found something "good" for free.

But well yeah here we are, i have build some "application" before, but i've used some "code" from GitHub but you know...
SLOW, to much memory usage (8gb on 10gb), so i've build the "app" again.

The app it works just fine and it's the type of app that dosen't occupy any side of the monitor,
you open and then boom it dissapear until the end where you se a "massage" that tell you it's done and it will close in 5 second (just to tell everything it is done).

The main function of the app it is just to verify that in a "batch" of image (png/jpg/jpeg/etc...) there is no duplicate,
the only "down point" is just the fact that you need to choose a whole folder of image and it will check them all.

I don't think that i will change that or "fix it" for my usage it's just fine like this.
But if you have the will and the time fell free to do that, just give some credit.
